17:16:48 : Direct: Antony-J: Yeah ikr 
17:16:49 : Direct: 47: last night it was 800k..
17:17:03 : Direct: Antony-J: I wonder who it is
17:17:04 : Direct: 47: Either im doing my job good, or im a shit admin people want dead..
17:17:18 : Direct: 47: both is fine, because i know who it is..
17:17:45 : Group: Ahmed: kalem
17:17:47 : Group: Ahmed: cunt
17:17:48 : Direct: 47: Last night they RDMed me without having the contract xD
17:17:55 : Direct: Antony-J: Hahaha
17:18:01 : Direct: 47: They had taken mine first and then another one and forgotten about the dot not changing.
17:18:08 : Direct: 47: I didnt do anything about it, its a honest mistake.
17:18:38 : Direct: 47: So what about the AFF? Do they still hate me because i picked up Mints weapon at oilrig?
17:18:49 : Direct: Antony-J: With the hitman licence being so cheap you get a lot of idiots with it now
17:19:01 : Direct: 47: Yea... Im gonna push for it to go to 4m again.
17:19:01 : Direct: Antony-J: Probably
17:19:06 : Direct: 47: Its turning to RDM
17:19:14 : Direct: Antony-J: I think it should be more than 4m tbh
17:19:24 : Direct: Antony-J: You can make a lot of money with it really quickly
17:19:28 : Direct: 47: I know for a fact that some richguys (wont say who) is putting random hits of 500k on people just to get people moving with it
17:19:47 : Direct: Antony-J: Rob comes on and does hits
17:19:52 : Direct: Antony-J: And stalks does aswell
17:19:57 : Direct: 47: Alrighjt you knew.-
17:20:09 : Direct: Antony-J: I know a lot more than people think i do
17:20:13 : Direct: Antony-J: :)
17:20:17 : Direct: 47: Well exactly as you said. Many have it now, and everyone will have hits on them in a few.
17:20:29 : Direct: 47: Well i only know you from FTP/GP.
17:20:32 : Direct: 47: As a good shot
17:20:41 : Direct: 47: Never really spoken to you..
17:20:53 : Direct: 47: So i dont know your influence.
17:21:35 : Direct: 47: The CM and Chicken gang wants me dead for sure
17:21:37 : Direct: 47: aff aswell
17:21:55 : Direct: 47: I might aswell just go medic full time xD And see people whine about the bounty not getting claimed.
17:22:00 : Direct: Antony-J: I dont really care about the people as long as you're worth money ill kill you :)
17:22:09 : Direct: 47: Yep.
17:22:12 : Direct: 47: Exactly.
17:22:30 : Direct: 47: I should start keeping track of my kills aswell..
17:22:32 : Direct: Antony-J: If you dont have a bounty there is a 80% chance i wont kill you
17:22:46 : Direct: 47: We are getting tags back in a few days btw.
17:22:49 : Direct: Antony-J: Ive claimed like 13 hits up to now but the last few days have been really slow
17:22:54 : Direct: 47: So bountyhunting will be a lot easier..
17:23:54 : Direct: 47: I just really want some RP..
17:24:01 : Direct: 47: I have had one good interaction as a cop.
17:24:05 : Direct: 47: But thats it.
17:24:33 : Direct: 47: And kalem just told me straight up that he have not RPed on this server yet, since he considers it a king of the hill server with the current rules.
17:24:50 : Direct: 47: So im at a loss, about what to do currently.
17:24:54 : Direct: Antony-J: Ive had a few good interactions as a cop ive only been playing cop for like 2 days
17:25:07 : Direct: 47: Yea the younger people and new people do rp
17:25:07 : Direct: Antony-J: We need to have a proper admin meeting
17:25:14 : Direct: 47: but the old people from ftp and such dont.
17:25:22 : Direct: 47: I was told we would have one this week.
17:25:24 : Direct: 47: last week
17:25:51 : Direct: 47: currently the admins are giving diffrent rules.
17:25:56 : Direct: Antony-J: Were having an aff meeting at 7 gonna see if we can get some stuff sorted
17:25:57 : Direct: 47: and its confusing af.
17:26:06 : Direct: 47: we have a metting at 08 aswell
17:26:13 : Direct: [APD] Chief. Stalks: well well well
17:28:12 : Direct: 47: 850k on stalks
17:28:44 : Direct: Antony-J: Well both you and him are just sat in the safe zone so either are no good :)
17:29:08 : Direct: 47: Yea, i understand.
17:29:20 : Direct: 47: Mine will be hard to claim since i only farm on civ at nighttime
17:29:29 : Direct: 47: and i play medic mostly atm due to noone being there.
17:29:33 : Direct: 47: and we do advertise medics..
17:30:00 : Direct: 47: But as stated at the hitman, its just bad luck if you are unable to get him.
17:30:09 : Direct: Antony-J: Can you claim the bounty by killing the medic?
17:30:10 : Direct: 47: So i might aswell let the bounty grow
17:30:14 : Direct: 47: You can yes.
17:30:17 : Direct: 47: But the money will be taken
17:30:26 : Direct: 47: Since the hit is placed on Chief inspector euka
17:30:29 : Direct: 47: Not Dr. Hermes.
17:30:42 : Direct: Antony-J: Ahh okay
17:30:47 : Direct: 47: You cant justify killing a medic just because you know its me.
17:31:05 : Direct: Antony-J: I know i wasnt going too, Was just wondering if you got the money
17:31:06 : Direct: 47: In auctuallity you should only be able to claim it on Chief Inspector Euka, and no this 47/
17:31:24 : Direct: 47: But thats just the system i guess.
17:31:32 : Direct: Antony-J: You're the one who said to come claim it ahaa
17:31:40 : Direct: 47: Im sure someone will try to kill me on medic
17:31:55 : Direct: 47: I was driving from airstation to here
17:31:57 : Direct: 47: SO yea xD
17:32:13 : Direct: 47: Do your map update with the dot, since you found me here?
17:32:31 : Direct: Antony-J: Nope
17:32:33 : Direct: 47: Goodi
17:33:13 : Direct: 47: Why not go claim the 850k on stalks?
17:33:20 : Direct: 47: He drove out of kavala probally on patrole.
17:33:25 : Direct: Antony-J: Because hes sat in base check farming
17:33:38 : Direct: 47: Uhm, want me to rob a station, so you  can kill him?`
17:33:39 : Direct: Antony-J: Like he is everytime i go for his bounty
17:33:42 : Direct: 47: Or will you simply claim mine?`
17:34:09 : Direct: Antony-J: I mean if you make a deal with me to lure out stalk i wont kill you
17:34:12 : Group: Sif: those see you in those tower
17:34:17 : Direct: 47: Alright its a deal then
17:34:21 : Direct: 47: Ringroad?

17:34:53 : Direct: 47: imma arm myself with a handgun opnly
