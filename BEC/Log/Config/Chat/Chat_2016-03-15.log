23:48:35 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: (So the cops regularly metagame?)
23:48:47 : Direct: [APD] Chief. Stalks: How so?
23:48:58 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: (How would a cop know what this place is?)
23:49:03 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: (What laws have you *seen* me break?)
23:49:11 : Direct: [ARM Cpt] Flames: thanks babes
23:49:17 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: Being a cop and hanging out at a gang hideout =/= RP
23:49:20 : Direct: [APD] Chief. Stalks: this is a drug processing area sir, we get a notice when one is taken over
23:49:29 : Group: [APD] Chief. Stalks: figgis, speak to this fella while i check inside
23:49:33 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: (So yeah, metagaming is regular conduct here?)
23:49:38 : Group: Sean Wolfington: i might get off
23:49:45 : Direct: [APD] Chief. Stalks: How is it metagaming?
23:49:49 : Direct: [ARM Cpt] Flames: 30k vibz
23:49:51 : Group: Sean Wolfington: 11
23:49:53 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: What exactly is it that informed you?
23:49:58 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: If it's a HUD which pops up due to a script,
23:50:03 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: Then the information is OUT OF CHARACTER.
23:50:06 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: Not In Character.
23:50:07 : Direct: [APD] Chief. Stalks: our system
23:50:16 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: Thus Your character, Chief Stalks, doesn't know this place was taken over.
23:50:37 : Group: Sean Wolfington: see the square?
23:50:38 : Direct: [APD] Sgt. Cyril Figgis: We've had reports of this place being  taken over by dispatch
23:50:41 : Group: Sean Wolfington: om ,a[
23:50:44 : Group: Sean Wolfington: on map
23:50:45 : Group: Sean Wolfington: there
23:50:48 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: And who plays dispatch?
23:50:51 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: How do *they* know?
23:50:59 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: It's all just because of the *scripts*
23:51:01 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: Thus, it's meta.
23:51:10 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: Realistically speaking there's *no* way for you to know.
23:51:10 : Direct: [APD] Sgt. Cyril Figgis: Reports from concerned citizens living near here
23:51:20 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: Honestly. If  the server supports metagaming, just say so.
23:51:20 : Direct: [APD] Sgt. Cyril Figgis: Someone called it in to our dispatch
23:51:24 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: I'll find a better server instead.
23:54:35 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: [Is Metagaming normal here?]
23:54:44 : Direct: [ARM Cpt] Flames: 30k vibz
23:54:53 : Direct: [APD] PC. Morrisino: WHAT DO YOU MEAN??
23:55:03 : Direct: Behemoth Alpha 5: [Is this a non-RP server?]
23:55:28 : Direct: [APD] PC. Morrisino: NO IT IS JUST SOME PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE ROLE PLAY THAN OTHERS 
23:57:47 : Direct: [ARM Cpt] Flames: 30k vibz
23:58:05 : Direct: [NHS] Callum Sweetlove: WHATS THE AIM TO WIN?
23:58:16 : Direct: [ARM Cpt] Flames: we just gambling
